## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `Controller`: view & service & model
    - `View`: only contain java swing and some data
    - `Service`: logic & view event control
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
